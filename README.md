CytoMCS-DF
=======

This is an extended version of CytoMCS for use in digital forensics. It allows to determine a flexible similarity of two data provenance graphs. Please follow the workflow procedure in the section below.

CytoMCS-DF was extended for data-provenance application but builds on the knowledge of Simon J. Larsen and Jan Baumbach (see reference section):
CytoMCS is a Cytoscape 3.0 app for computing the maximum common edge subgraph between two or more large networks.
The app uses an iterative local search algorithm to find large conserved subgraphs, and is able to detect not only fully conserved edges, but also partially conserved. CytoMCS supports both directed and undirected networks.

## Installation

<!--- The Cytoscape app is available through the Cytoscape app store here: http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cytomcs. -->

## Compilation

First clone and compile the FaithMCS repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/SimonLarsen/faithmcs.git
cd faithmcs
mvn package
```

Then clone the CytoMCS-DF repository, install the FaithMCS package locally and compile:

```
git clone https://github.com/LudwigEnglbrecht/cytomcs-df.git
cd cytomcs-df
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/faithmcs-0.2.jar
mvn package
```

The compiled Cytoscape 3.0 app can then be found in cytomcs/target/cytomcs-1.1.jar.
